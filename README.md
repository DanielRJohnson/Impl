# Impl
(WIP) A cute little LISP dialect geared towards generating images

# TODO

~~comments~~

~~quote notation~~

derived expression types:
* cond?
* ~~let~~

~~strings~~

~~booleans~~

~~":" literals~~

~~loop structure~~

~~sufficient error detection, not ground-breaking. just a toy language~~

Actual image stuff lmao:
* Position type
* Color type
* builtin procedures to generate images/animations:
  * setpixel
  * snap!
  * etc.

macros?
